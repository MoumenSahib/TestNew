               // the first group is the owner permission ... the second group is the groups permission ... the third group is the public users.
               // the segment in each group represent r : read, w : write, x for execute .. like if you have an executable file you can executed.
               // usually any of the permission types starts either with (-) or (d) ... d : directory , - : file.
               // usually it is divided when changing permission to (o) other users (g) group (u) user {owner}


To change permission on a folder or file use 
>> chmod o+w "filename" (or "folderName")
--------(other users + write access)
>> chmod o-w "filename" (or "foldername")


Another way to work with permissions
>> chmod 754 "filename" (or "folderName")
---------ugo--------- (u user g group o others)

4 -----(read)
2 -----(write)
1 -----(execute)
0 -----(no permission)

so in the previous example 754 (7 is 4+2+1 for the owner (user) , 5 is 4+1 for the group , 4 is 4 for the other users) and so on...
